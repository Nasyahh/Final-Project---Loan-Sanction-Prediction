# Final-Project---Loan-Sanction-Prediction
### by: Erike Nasyah Herman

  After 3 months of Data Science bootcamp in Purwadhika Digital School, I finished this final project as one of requirements to graduate from JCDS program. This project comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phileinsophos/predict-loan-amount-data?select=test.csv) which I find as interesting dataset. Start from Exploratory Data Analysis, I found that only some features are related with loan sanction, despite the amount of features given in the dataset. In the notebook file, I explore, clean and encode the dataframe before modelling. Cross Validation is conducted to find the best base regression model, and then I use Random Forest Regression model with Hyper Parameter Tuning. The result is prediction with high accuracy and low error percentage as included in notebook file.

  Eventhough this project is named as 'Final Project', it doesn't mean this is the last one. I look forward for more chances to practice in Data Science and learn to be better day by day.
